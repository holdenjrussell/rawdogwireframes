              <div>
                <h3>Why We Started Rawdog</h3>
                <p>
                  We've worked for some of the biggest names in e-commerce and beauty‚Äîfrom corporate giants to dropshipping operations. We've seen it all: brands that prioritize profit margins over product quality, companies that laugh at their customers behind closed doors, and businesses that treat employees as expendable resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We got tired of it. Tired of working for companies that didn't give a damn about the people using their products. Tired of seeing brands cut corners on ingredients while charging premium prices. Tired of the industry treating men's skincare as an afterthought.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>We decided to build something different.</strong>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>The Movement from Food to Beauty</h3>
                <p>
                  We're witnessing a revolution in consumer awareness. It started with food‚Äîpeople began questioning harmful dyes, seed oils, and processed ingredients. They demanded transparency and better options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now that same consciousness is moving into beauty and skincare. People are realizing that what you put ON your body is just as important as what you put IN your body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Rawdog is leading this transition</strong>‚Äîbringing the same ingredient scrutiny and health-first approach that transformed the food industry into men's skincare.

                  Our team has worked with some of the biggest names in beauty and e-commerce. We've seen how these companies operate from the inside‚Äîthe good, the bad, and the ugly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We learned valuable lessons about scale, operations, and what it takes to build successful brands. But we also witnessed the dark side: profit-first mentalities, corner-cutting on ingredients, and a fundamental disconnect from customer needs.

                  We've also worked in the fast-paced world of e-commerce startups and dropshipping operations. This experience taught us agility, customer acquisition, and how to move quickly in competitive markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, we also saw how the pressure for quick profits often led to compromised product quality and customer service. Many brands were more focused on the next sale than the next satisfied customer.
