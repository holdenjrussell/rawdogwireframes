    {
      id: '1',
      category: 'products',
      question: 'What makes rawdog different from other skincare brands?',
      answer: 'rawdog is the first and only seed oil-free skincare brand built specifically for men. We use biomimetic ingredients like beef tallow that closely match your skin\'s natural composition, combined with clinically-proven actives. We eliminate all endocrine disruptors, synthetic fragrances, and harmful chemicals while maintaining premium performance.'
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      category: 'products',
      question: 'Is beef tallow really good for skin?',
      answer: 'Yes! Beef tallow has a fatty acid profile remarkably similar to human sebum, making it incredibly compatible with your skin. It\'s rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K, provides deep moisturization without clogging pores, and strengthens the skin barrier. Unlike plant oils that can oxidize and cause irritation, tallow is stable and non-comedogenic.'
    },
    {
      id: '3',
      category: 'products',
      question: 'Are your products suitable for all skin types?',
      answer: 'Yes, our products are formulated to work with all skin types - oily, dry, combination, and sensitive. The biomimetic nature of our ingredients means they work with your skin\'s natural processes rather than against them. However, we always recommend patch testing if you have particularly sensitive skin.'
    },
    {
      id: '4',
      category: 'products',
      question: 'What is your recommended skincare routine?',
      answer: 'Morning: 1) Cleanse with our Hydrating Facial Cleanser, 2) Apply Caffeine Under Eye Cream to reduce puffiness, 3) Moisturize with our Face Moisturizer. Evening: 1) Cleanse to remove daily buildup, 2) Apply Eye Cream focusing on fine lines, 3) Finish with Face Moisturizer for overnight repair.'
    },
    {
      id: '5',
      category: 'products',
      question: 'Are your products cruelty-free?',
      answer: 'Yes, all rawdog products are cruelty-free. We never test on animals and work only with suppliers who share our ethical standards. Our beef tallow is sourced from grass-fed cattle as a byproduct of the food industry, making use of ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.'
    },

    },

    // Subscriptions
    {
      id: '14',
      category: 'subscriptions',
      question: 'How do subscriptions work?',
      answer: 'Subscribe to any product and save 15% on every order, plus get free shipping. Choose your delivery frequency (30, 60, or 90 days), and we\'ll automatically send your products when you need them. You can skip, pause, or cancel anytime.'

      category: 'subscriptions',
      question: 'Can I change my subscription frequency?',
